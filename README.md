### This is Plague speaking...

Hi there!
I'm an internet drifter dabbling in a little bit of everything. I love backend programming, learning foreign languages, and yapping with friends.

☆ I am currently learning basic webdev<br/>
☆ For more, see my [personal website](https://neocities.org/)<br/>
☆ You're also welcome to check out my [professional portfolio](https://neocities.org/)<br/>
☆ And I [welcome messages](https://neocities.org/), although my response time tends to be slow...<br/>

This is my github base for projects that are a liiiiittle too silly for corporate, and experimental activities I don't want to get crossed with projects in production.
So you might find a lot of wonky commits, low quality art, or incomplete endeavors.

Thanks for dropping by ~(•⩊•)
